        "description": "Classic Italian pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and black pepper.", 
        "filename": "/public/img/spahetti-carbonara.jpg",
        "ingredients": "12 ounces (340g) spaghetti pasta. 4 ounces (115g) pancetta or guanciale, diced. 3 large eggs. 1 cup (about 100g) grated Pecorino Romano cheese. 1/2 cup (about 50g) grated Parmesan cheese. Freshly ground black pepper. Salt (for pasta water).",
        "instructions": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti and set aside. While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta or guanciale and cook until golden and crisp, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined. Once the spaghetti is cooked and drained, immediately transfer it to the skillet with the cooked pancetta or guanciale. Toss the spaghetti with the pancetta/guanciale and its rendered fat over low heat for about 1 minute, allowing the pasta to absorb some of the flavor. Remove the skillet from the heat. Quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot spaghetti while continuously tossing or stirring the pasta to evenly coat it with the sauce. The residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce. If the sauce seems too thick, gradually add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a little at a time, until the desired consistency is reached. Season the spaghetti carbonara generously with freshly ground black pepper. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary, keeping in mind that the pancetta or guanciale and cheeses are already salty. Serve the spaghetti carbonara immediately, garnished with additional grated cheese and black pepper if desired. Enjoy your delicious traditional Italian dish!",
